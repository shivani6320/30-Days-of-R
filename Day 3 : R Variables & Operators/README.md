# Day 3 : R Variables & Operators

## Variables:

R supports three ways of variable assignment:

1. Using equal operator- data is copied from right to left.
2. Using leftward operator- data is copied from right to left.
3. Using rightward operator- data is copied from left to right.

R Variables Syntax: 
```
#using equal to operator 

variable_name = value

#using leftward operator 

variable_name <- value

#using rightward operator 

value -> variable_name
```
## Operators :
R supports majorly four kinds of binary operators between a set of operands:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Logical Operators
3. Relational Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Miscellaneous Operator
