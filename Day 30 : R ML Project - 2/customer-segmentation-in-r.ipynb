These are not one-size-fits-all, and you should do what is right for your business.\n\nCustomer segmentation can be broken down into two types:\n\n#### 1) Segmenting customers based on who they are:\nThe process of understanding who customers are typically focuses on demographics. This will include factors such as:\n- Age\n- Geography\n- Urbanisation – are they city or rural?\n- Income\n- Relationship status\n- Family\n- Job type\n\n#### 2) Segmenting customers based on what they do:\nYou can also segment customers based on how much they spend (share of wallet), how often, and what products (this allows you to see how much you can increase spend). This is more behaviour focused.\n\nBreaking this down even further, behaviour can vary and you might want to look to separate as follows:\n- Basket size\n- Share of wallet\n- Tenure (how long they stay with you)\n- Longterm loyalty (a function of share of wallet and tenure)\n\n#### 3) Why Segment Customers?\n\n- Customer segmentation is popular because it helps you market and sell more effectively. This is because you can develop a better understanding of your customers’ needs and desires.\n- The business impact of doing this is even more important, and effective customer segmentation will help you to increase customer lifetime value. This means they will stay longer, and spend more.\n\n\n#### 4) Using Customer Segmentation...\n\nA Company can :\n- Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not with others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests, instead).\n- Select the best communication channel for the segment, which might be email, social media posts, radio advertising, or another approach, depending on the segment. \n- Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities.\n- Establish better customer relationships.\n- Test pricing options.\n- Focus on the most profitable customers.\n- Improve customer service.\n- Upsell and cross-sell other products and services.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About dataset :\nThe Dataset contains the information about the customers like Sex, Marital status, Age, Education, Income Occupation
