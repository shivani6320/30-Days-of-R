- Data Frames in R Language are generic data objects of R which are used to store the tabular data.
- Data frames can also be interpreted as matrices where each column of a matrix can be of the different data types.

### Create Dataframe in R Programming Language
To create a data frame in R use **data.frame()** command and then pass each of the vectors you have created as arguments to the function.

### Get the Structure of the R â€“ Data Frame
One can get the structure of the data frame using **str()** function in R. It can display even the internal structure of large lists which are nested. It provides one-liner output for the basic R objects letting the user know about the object and its constituents. 

### ummary of data in the data frame
In R data frame, the statistical summary and nature of the data can be obtained by applying **summary()** function. It is a generic function used to produce result summaries of the results of various model fitting functions. The function invokes particular methods which depend on the class of the first argument. 

### Extract Data from Data Frame in R Language
Extract data from a data frame means that to access its rows or columns. One can extract a specific column from a data frame using its column name. 

### Expand Data Frame
A data frame in R can be expanded by adding new columns and rows to the already existing data frame.
